# Patient-Queue-System
The objective of this C++ program is to simulate a patient queue system in a healthcare setting. Three types of nurses, each specializing in wound care, adult patients, or children. The program tracks patient arrivals, assigns them to specific nurses when available, and simulates the time each patient spends with their respective nurse.
